Are you tired when reviewing code on a pull request, to spend too much time on (important yet time consuming) details, such as:

 * Is the code PSR valid ?
 * Did the developer though of adding the config key in the right file ?
 * Are the SQL migrations generated ?
 * **Any recurrent requirements your applications needs developer to be reminded of ?**

It can save time for your team by avoiding them to check rather insistently for common mistake and focus on code architecture, algoritmh, comprehension...
